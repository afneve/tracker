The layers of glacial till and buried forest can be seen on the side of the steep bluff along the lakeshore due to wave erosion. Some features may be harder to see during the summer months because of ground cover. Wood from the forest has been radiocarbon-dated at 11,850 years before present.

The Cardy Site, marked by a kiosk and plaque, preserves the remains of a campsite used by Native Americans at the end of the Ice Age. An extensive dig in 2003 unearthed spear points, tools, a fire pit and other artifacts. Archeologists believe that Native Americans lived and worked in this area 11,000 years ago near the shore of Glacial Lake Algonquin and within walking distance of the receding continental ice sheet. This camp is unusual for its far north location. Glacial Lake Algonquin occupied the Lake Michigan and Lake Huron basins at the end of the Ice Age and would have been about 25 feet higher than Green Bay is today.","PointsofInterest/SideTrail2":" "}
